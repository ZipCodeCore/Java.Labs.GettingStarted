# Getting Started (on Day One)


Get your Mac onto the classroom wifi. How? Look around.

**Important**: It should go without saying that anytime you are asked to create an account you should ALWAYS:

* *Make sure to use a professional username/handle.* We recommend the username incorporates your name. 
* Be sure to add an appropriate avatar (picture or image) to your profile. 



### gmail

IF you have not already gotten a _professional email address_ for use within the course

* Visit [gmail.com](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/) and create an account.
* make *sure* you choose a *business friendly* username.

### github

If you haven't already, 

* Visit [github.com](https://github.com/) and signup for an account.  

### iCloud

Use your spiffy new business gmail account to create an iCloud account (if you don't already have one from your iPhone).
Even if you're an *android-head*, use iCloud for certain things when you're using Apple products. You can always login later on [iCloud](iCloud.com) to access stuff from windoze or android.

### Passwords

Use the built-in macOS password manager to manage all of your accounts. (This way you can keep track of your Admin password for MySQL, which I guarantee you will otherwise forget.)
Be sure to get a free iCloud account using your "professional email address" if you don't already have one tied to an iPhone.

DO NOT USE "Find My Mac" - It makes Renee's life terrible, and you don't want that. Nope, you surely don't.
